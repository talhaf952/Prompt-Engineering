
1st Lecture:
We'll learn some prompting best practices for software development, then we'll cover some common use cases, summarizing, inferring, transforming, expanding, and then we'll build a chatbot 
using an LLM. We hope that this will spark our imagination about new applications that you can build. So in the development of large language models or LLMs, there have been broadly two types of LLMs.
1. Base LLMs
2. instruction-tuned LLMs. 
So, base LLM has been trained to predict the next word based on text training data, often trained on a large amount of data from the internet and other sources to figure out what's the next most likely word to follow. So, for example, if you were to prompt us once upon a time there was a unicorn, it may complete
